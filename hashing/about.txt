Inside main we can declare an int array upto 1e6 and boot 1e7
but we can declare an int array upto 1e7 globally and bool 1e8
There are 256 characters so it is enough to keep array size upto 256 for character hashing

Manual hashing using hash array
Time complexity: 0(Q*N)

Hashing using map:
Time complexity:
    Storing: O(log(N)) where N is the no. of elements in map
    Fetching: 0(log(N))

Hashing using unordered map:
Time complexity:
    Storing: O(1) for best and average case and O(N) for worst case that very rarely happens

Hashing methods:
1) Division method: modulus by 10 is taken and sorted under each last digit array
2) Folding method
3) Mad square method

1) For eg.
take an array [2, 5, 16, 28, 139, 38, 48, 28, 18]
              [2, 5,  6,  8,   9,  8,  8,  8,  8]  

0 -> 
1 -> 
2 -> 5
3 -> 
4 -> 
5 -> 5
6 -> 16
7 -> 
8 -> 18-> 28 -> 28 -> 38 -> 48
9 -> 139

Collision: if many values end up in same index(for eg. 8 in the above case), due to which 0(N) happens in unordered_map on blue moon
