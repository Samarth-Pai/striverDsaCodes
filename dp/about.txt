Way of solving a dp question
1. Tabulation: bottom up: go from base case to required answer
2. Memoization: top down
Memoization -> Tabulation -> Space optimization

Steps of memoization:
0. Declare an array of size no. of subproblems
1. Storing the answer which has been computed for every subproblems
2. Checking if the subproblem has been previously solved

Detection of a DP problems:
Count the total number of ways
Min or max output
Try all possible ways(count/ figure out best way) using recursion

Shortcuts
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement
3. If question states count: Sum up all stuffs
    else if question states min/ max: then find min/ max of all the stuffs

Thumb rule:
There will be always space optimization when there is i-2 i- 1
